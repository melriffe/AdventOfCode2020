# AdventOfCode2020

My first foray into the [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020) exercises

----

## Advent Of Code

This is my first time participating in the Advent of Code programming puzzles.

I'm starting on 11th Dec 2020.

This file will change as I develop a rhythm, and figure out how best to attack and categorize the exercises in this project.

## Language of Solutions

While I was/am inspired by [Dad and Kids Coding](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9Sy-cVGzUCt0HkSEadfzYw) and their use of [Pharo](https://pharo.org/) Smalltalk, I have not gained the confidence or competence (I once had) to follow suit. Therefore my solutions will be done in [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/).

I will be using [RSpec](https://relishapp.com/rspec/) to verify my solutions.

I will organize by Days, as they are presented on the AoC website.
